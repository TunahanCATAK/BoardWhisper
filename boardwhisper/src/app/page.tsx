            Material is even. <br />
             White: King safety is good, rooks ideally placed in the center. Knight and Bishops good placed and well developed, Queen aiming at the black king. Good pawn structure for white as well, with no weak pawns and 2 pawn islands. <br />
            Black: King safety is okay, the rooks are not connected which is a problem. The bishops for black are better than the white bishops as they occupy the two longest diagonals of the board. The knight is very passive on the eight rank and needs to be improved for the rooks to be connected. <br />
            The queen on b7 working together with the bishop on c6 creating a battery pointing at the white king looks fine too. Black has a good pawn structure on the kingside but on the queenside he has one isolated pawn which is weak. What should be the plan for black? to improve the knight, connect the rooks and get them to the center! So a good plan for black is 1...g6 followed by Ng7-Nf5 and then go Rfd8 and Rac8. After that all of blacks pieces are good placed and black is better.
